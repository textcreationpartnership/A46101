            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Impartial ACCOUNT OF THE MISFORTUNE That lately happened to the Right Honourable PHILIP Earl of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> and <hi>Montgomery.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is certainly very difficult to judge whether the ſcurrilous Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of our Modern-ſawcy-Pamphlet-Scriblers (who write any thing ſo they may come firſt to get the Penny) or the inſolent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of an ignorant Conſtable, and his worſe than High-way-men Watch, are leſs tolerable; the former either miſtakes or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that Crime which his Brother Coxcomb (if not altogether the Cauſe) is ſure to have the greateſt ſhare in: as in the particular Caſe of this Noble Lord, is too plainly demonſtrable, a Perſon of that admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſs, Affability, and Generoſity, that Nature was obliged to throw in ſomewhat more of humane frailty, leſt his more Eminent Vertues ſhould render him almoſt the Envy of Mankind; one that is never mentioned but with Reſpect and Honour by all that know him, and reputed ill by onely ſuch as are not worthy his Acquaintance. Who going on Wedneſday laſt, as well to take the Air as his leave of the Lords <hi>D.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> intending then ſuddenly for <hi>Wilton,</hi> was eſpied by one <hi>Smeethe</hi> a Gentleman, ſome ſay, and belonging to the Court, others no better than a Prize-Player; but what e're he was, he was heard to ſay, theſe words: <hi>Yonder goes the mad Peer; we ſhall have him come back again drunk at Twelve of the clock; but I'le be upon the Watch my ſelf to night, and ſee what Mettle he's made of; I'le ſee if I can tame him.</hi> And indeed he had like to have been as good as his word, for his Lordſhip coming back, though not in drink as Mr. <hi>Smeethe</hi> before ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miz'd, was rudely ſet upon by the ſaid <hi>Smeethe,</hi> who before had taken the Conſtables Staff from him, becauſe he was unwilling to interrupt my Lord in his going home, and perſwaded <hi>Smeethe</hi> likewiſe not to diſturb him. Notwithſtanding this, <hi>Smeethe</hi> commands the Coach to ſtop, my Lord to drive on; upon that, <hi>Smeethe</hi> and his Accomplices knock the Poſtillian and Coachman down; and then with rough and unmannerly Language, demands of his Lordſhip where he had been, and whither go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45854:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 55 -->
who made no other Anſwer but that he was <hi>PEMBROKE,</hi> and going home; but <hi>Smeethe</hi> perſiſting in his impertinent Queſtions, my Lord cry'd out, <hi>What ails theſe fellows, do ye intend to rob me?</hi> upon which <hi>Smeethe</hi> and the reſt puſht at my Lord and his Company with their Staves, ſo that my Lord was obliged to quit his Coach: which he had no ſooner done, but <hi>Smeethe</hi> was ſo near <hi>taming of him,</hi> as he call'd it, that he knockt his Lordſhip flat on the ground; who endeavouring to get up, and draw his Sword (ſtill ſtaggering with the blow) reel'd upon <hi>Smeethe;</hi> and Providence at the ſame time turning the Tables, brought that fate upon <hi>Smeethe,</hi> which unqueſtionably he intended to his Lordſhip. Nor had this Quarrel gone ſo far, if his Lordſhip had condeſcended to give them that Money to drink which they ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demanded. As for the other perſon, by name Mr. <hi>Half-penny,</hi> who in truth is a Conſtable; it may be ſaid of him as it was of a much better man who loſt his Life at <hi>Maestricht</hi> out of his Poſt, <hi>What made him there?</hi> When according to his Duty and Oath he ought to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care of his own Watch, and not drinking with another Conſtable upon his. All this while there was onely his Lordſhip and one Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that endeavoured to defend themſelves; another and his Lordſhips ſervants being wholly imployed in perſwading and begging of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Watchmen to ſpare his Lordſhip and his generous Aſſiſtant: which they were ſo far from granting, that the very Supplicants themſelves, who endeavoured all they could to preſerve the peace, ſhar'd in his Lordſhips Fortune, and were all knockt down, and his Lordſhip ſeized, and hurried to a little houſe on <hi>Turnham-Green;</hi> from whence about one of the clock his Lordſhip came for <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the real Truth of the whole Action, and will be atteſted by ſeveral People of Worth and Quality, whenever his Lordſhip ſhall be call'd to his Tryal.</p>
            <p>And now it may be neceſſary to undeceive the world, and let them know, that this is not the twenty ſixth man my Lord of <hi>Pembrooke</hi> has kill'd, as hath been impudently aſſerted in Coffee-houſes ſince this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident; when in truth every ſenſible man is, or may be eaſily aſſur'd, that his Lordſhip was never taxed with any thing of this nature, but that of Mr. <hi>Coney:</hi> And then beſides the Acquittal of his Peers, there were ſome Phyſicians did aſſert, that Mr. <hi>Coney</hi> did not die of the Bruiſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by my Lord of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> but of an inward Cauſe acquired by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Relation had never come forth, but to ſatisfie the tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the People, who after ſuch an Accident (though never ſo unavoidable) are always talking and often dreaming of Murder and Deſtruction. And to aſſure them that his Lordſhip is no Monſter, has no Cloven-feet, no Sawcer-eyes, but is e'en just ſuch another Man as their own Relations; onely with this difference, That he has more Gallantry and Honour, and cannot bear the inſolent Affronts of the</hi> MOBILE <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reſentment.</hi>
